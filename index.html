            <p>I am Anam Mofazzal Durjoy. My study life was kind of inconsistence in a sense of changing school very frequently. I started my primary education at govt. primary school near my house. After 3 years, i joined another school in Khetlal sub-district. I completed my 5th level in there. Then i joined a cadet coaching to get admitted into Cadet college. But unfortunately i couldn't make it happened. Later i joined another private school in Bogra. After one year, i got chance in DRMC and i admitted there in class 8. I studied there till completion of my HSC. Now I am graduated from East West University.</p>
